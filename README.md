# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This code creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a 3x3 grid where two players (X and O) take turns clicking cells to place their marks. The game checks for winning combinations or a tie after each move and updates the status message accordingly. A restart button lets players reset the game and start over.
